# Finite-State-Machine-Application-1101-Sequence-Detector
This repository contains the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) application for detecting the "1101" sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the design and functionality of an FSM in digital logic and sequential circuit design.
