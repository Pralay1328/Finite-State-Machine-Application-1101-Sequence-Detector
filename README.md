# Finite-State-Machine-Application-1101-Sequence-Detector
This repository contains the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) application for detecting the "1101" sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the design and functionality of an FSM in digital logic and sequential circuit design.

# Features:
 1. 1101 Sequence Detection: The application is designed to detect the occurrence of the "1101" sequence within a stream of binary input data.
 
 2. State Transition Diagram: A graphical representation of the state transition diagram is provided to illustrate the behavior of the FSM.
 
 3. Implementation Details: The implementation includes Verilog/VHDL code for the FSM, simulation files, and test benches for verification.

 4. Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided to explain the design methodology, state transition logic, and simulation results.

# Implementation:

 1. First a Prototype of the machine was made by seeing the state diagram using different combinational and Sequential Digital Electronics Components

 2. An Online model was made on TinkerCAD Software.

# Components Used:
   1. 3-Input AND Gate - IC 7411
   2. 2-Input AND Gate - IC 7408
   3. 2-Input OR Gate - IC 7432
   4. 3-Input OR Gate - IC 74HC4075
   5. D-Flip Flop IC 7474
   6. Sequence Generator
