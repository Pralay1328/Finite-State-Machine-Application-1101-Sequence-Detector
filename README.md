# Finite-State-Machine-Application-1101-Sequence-Detector
This repository contains the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) application for detecting the "1101" sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the design and functionality of an FSM in digital logic and sequential circuit design.
Features:
1101 Sequence Detection: The application is designed to detect the occurrence of the "1101" sequence within a stream of binary input data.
State Transition Diagram: A graphical representation of the state transition diagram is provided to illustrate the behavior of the FSM.
Implementation Details: The implementation includes Verilog/VHDL code for the FSM, simulation files, and test benches for verification.
Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided to explain the design methodology, state transition logic, and simulation results.
